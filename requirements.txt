# The following pinning is to keep zaza compatible with python 3.6
#
# protobuf dropped support for python-3.6 in v3.20.0[0], although it wasn't
# until 4.21.0 that it became truly incompatible. The pinning used is `<4.21.0`

# macaroonbakery in v1.3.4 added a constraint of protobuf>=3.20.0[0] which makes it incompatible with python 3.6
