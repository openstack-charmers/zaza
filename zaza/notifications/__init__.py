"""Notification framework for zaza.

This module provides a pub-sub notification framework within zaza to enable
functions to be called at particular points in the zaza framework's lifecycle.

A function can be subscribed for a notification based on a particular
"interest" in the function.  i.e. before, after, both, exception or all.

    NotifyType.BEFORE: Function is called before something happens.
    NotifyType.AFTER: Function is called after something happens.
    NotifyType.BOTH: Function is called before and after something
                          happens.
    NotifyType.EXCEPTION: Function is called if an exception occurs.
    NotifyType.ALL: Function is called for all of the events.

So a handler can be subscribed for a function.  The handler is called with the
notification event, and the notification type, and then any params that the
notification function provided.
